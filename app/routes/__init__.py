# This file is empty and serves to make Python treat the routes directory as a package.
# This is necessary to import and organize the different route modules (e.g., auth, chat, group, user) cleanly within the application.
# While itâ€™s empty, it allows you to import routes using from app.routes import auth_blueprint, for example.

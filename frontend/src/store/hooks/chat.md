**Import statements**

1. `import { useAppStore } from "../store";`:
	* This line imports the `useAppStore` hook from the `../store` file, which provides access to the global application state and dispatch function.
2. `import { Chat, Message } from "../types";`:
	* This line imports the `Chat` and `Message` types from the `../types` file, which defines the data structures for chats and messages.
3. `import { useOpenChat } from "./currentChat";`:
	* This line imports the `useOpenChat` hook from the `./currentChat` file, which provides a way to manage the currently open chat.

**`useChatActions` hook**

The `useChatActions` hook is a custom hook that returns an object with four properties:

1. `chats`: The current list of chats from the global state.
2. `create`: A function to create a new chat.
3. `list`: A function to fetch the list of chats.
4. `send`: A function to send a new message in a chat.

**`validate` function**

The `validate` function checks if a valid JWT token is present in local storage. If the token is present and not undefined, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This function is used to validate the authentication status before making API requests.

**`create` function**

The `create` function takes an `withEmail` parameter and creates a new chat with the user who owns that email. Here's what it does:

1. It calls the `validate` function to check if the user is authenticated.
2. If authenticated, it sends a POST request to the `/chat/create` endpoint with the `withEmail` parameter in the request body.
3. If the request is successful, it dispatches a `NEW_CHAT` action to the global state with the new chat data as the payload.

**`list` function**

The `list` function fetches the list of chats that the authenticated user is involved in. Here's what it does:

1. It calls the `validate` function to check if the user is authenticated.
2. If authenticated, it sends a GET request to the `/chat/list` endpoint.
3. If the request is successful, it dispatches a `SET_CHATS` action to the global state with the fetched chat list as the payload.

**`send` function**

The `send` function takes a `chat_id` and `content` (message text) as parameters and sends a new message in the specified chat. Here's what it does:

1. It calls the `validate` function to check if the user is authenticated.
2. If authenticated, it sends a POST request to the `/chat/send` endpoint with the `chat_id` and `content` parameters in the request body.
3. If the request is successful, it fetches the newly created message and updates the chat's message list in the global state.
4. It also updates the currently open chat by calling the `open` function from the `useOpenChat` hook.

**Return statement**

The `useChatActions` hook returns an object with the `chats` property, which is the current list of chats from the global state, and the `create`, `list`, and `send` functions.

By using this custom hook, components can easily access and manage chat-related actions, such as creating new chats, listing chats, and sending messages.

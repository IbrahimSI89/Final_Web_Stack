**1. `@tailwind base;`**
`@tailwind base;` is a directive that imports Tailwind CSS's base styles. These base styles include a set of low-level, utility-focused styles that are used to normalize the styling of HTML elements across different browsers and devices. By including `@tailwind base;`, you're telling Tailwind to load its base styles, which will provide a solid foundation for your application's styling.

**2. `@tailwind components;`**
`@tailwind components;` is a directive that imports Tailwind CSS's component styles. Component styles are pre-designed UI components that can be used to build common interface elements, such as buttons, forms, navigation, and more. These components are designed to be highly customizable and can be easily extended or modified using Tailwind's utility classes.

**3. `@tailwind utilities;`**
`@tailwind utilities;` is a directive that imports Tailwind CSS's utility classes. Utility classes are low-level, single-purpose classes that can be used to apply specific styles to HTML elements. These classes are designed to be highly flexible and can be combined to create complex styles. By including `@tailwind utilities;`, you're giving yourself access to a wide range of utility classes that can be used to style your application.

**4. `:root` selector**
The `:root` selector targets the root element of the HTML document, which is typically the `<html>` element. This selector is used to define global styles that will be applied to the entire application.

**5. `font-family` property**
The `font-family` property specifies the font family to use for the application. In this case, the font family is set to `Inter, system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`. This means that the application will use the Inter font family, falling back to system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, and sans-serif in that order if Inter is not available.

**6. `line-height` property**
The `line-height` property specifies the line height of text in the application. A value of `1.5` means that the line height will be 1.5 times the font size.

**7. `font-weight` property**
The `font-weight` property specifies the font weight of text in the application. A value of `400` means that the font weight will be normal (not bold or light).

**8. `color-scheme` property**
The `color-scheme` property specifies the color scheme to use for the application. A value of `light dark` means that the application will use a light color scheme by default, but can also adapt to a dark color scheme if the user prefers.

**9. `color` property**
The `color` property specifies the text color of the application. A value of `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87)` means that the text color will be a light gray color with an opacity of 0.87.

**10. `background-color` property**
The `background-color` property specifies the background color of the application. A value of `#242424` means that the background color will be a dark gray color.

**11. `font-synthesis` property**
The `font-synthesis` property specifies whether the browser should synthesize font styles (e.g., bold, italic) if they are not available in the font family. A value of `none` means that font synthesis will be disabled.

**12. `text-rendering` property**
The `text-rendering` property specifies the rendering mode for text in the application. A value of `optimizeLegibility` means that the browser will prioritize legibility over speed when rendering text.

**13. `-webkit-font-smoothing` property**
The `-webkit-font-smoothing` property specifies the font smoothing mode for WebKit browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari). A value of `antialiased` means that the browser will use antialiasing to smooth out font edges.

**14. `-moz-osx-font-smoothing` property**
The `-moz-osx-font-smoothing` property specifies the font smoothing mode for Mozilla browsers (e.g., Firefox) on macOS. A value of `grayscale` means that the browser will use grayscale font smoothing.

**15. `html, body, #root` selectors**
These selectors target the `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<#root>` elements, respectively. The styles defined here will be applied to these elements.

**16. `height: 100%` property**
The `height: 100%` property specifies that the elements should take up the full height of their parent element.

**17. `margin: 0` property**

**Section 1: Purpose and How It Works comments (lines 1-4)**
```
// Purpose:
//      A layout component that uses React Router's Outlet to render nested routes.

// How It Works:
//        The Layout component serves as a wrapper for pages,
//  rendering the appropriate child component based on the current route.
```
These comments explain the purpose and functionality of the `Layout` component. It's a layout component that uses React Router's `Outlet` to render nested routes. In other words, it's a wrapper component that will render the correct child component based on the current route.

**Section 2: Importing React Router's Outlet (line 6)**
```
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
```
This line imports the `Outlet` component from the `react-router-dom` library. The `Outlet` component is a built-in component in React Router that acts as a placeholder for nested routes. It's used to render the child components of a route.

**Section 3: Defining the Layout component (lines 8-13)**
```
const Layout: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Outlet />
    </>
  );
};
```
This section defines the `Layout` component as a functional component (FC) using the `React.FC` type. The `Layout` component returns a JSX fragment (`<>`) that contains a single child element: the `Outlet` component.

**Section 4: Exporting the Layout component (line 14)**
```
export default Layout;
```
This line exports the `Layout` component as the default export of the module. This allows other components to import and use the `Layout` component.

**Concepts explained:**

1. **React Router's Outlet**: The `Outlet` component is a built-in component in React Router that acts as a placeholder for nested routes. It's used to render the child components of a route.
2. **Functional Component (FC)**: A functional component is a type of React component that uses a function to return JSX elements. In this case, the `Layout` component is defined as a functional component using the `React.FC` type.
3. **JSX Fragment**: A JSX fragment is a way to group multiple JSX elements together without adding an extra DOM node. In this case, the `Layout` component returns a JSX fragment (`<>`) that contains the `Outlet` component.
4. **Default Export**: The `export default` statement is used to export the `Layout` component as the default export of the module. This allows other components to import and use the `Layout` component without specifying a specific name.

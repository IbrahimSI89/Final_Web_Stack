**Overview**

This is a React functional component named `SignUp` that allows users to create an account. It's built using React Hooks, React Router, and a custom authentication store.

**Importing dependencies**

The component imports the following dependencies:

* `useState` from React, used to manage local state.
* `Link` and `useNavigate` from React Router, used for client-side routing.
* `useAuthActions` from a custom authentication store, used to interact with the authentication layer.

**Defining the component**

The `SignUp` component is defined as a functional component with no props.

**Local state management**

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage local state for the sign-up form fields. The initial state is an object with five properties: `name`, `username`, `email`, `password`, and `confirmPassword`. The `setFormData` function is used to update the state when the user interacts with the form.

**useAuthActions and useNavigate**

The component uses the `useAuthActions` hook to access actions from the authentication store, such as `register`. It also uses the `useNavigate` hook to access the `navigator` function, which allows navigation to different routes after successful registration.

**Event handlers**

There are two event handlers:

* `handleInputChange`: updates the form field values as the user types.
* `handleSubmit`: handles the form submission, validating the input and registering the user.

**Form validation**

Basic validation is performed on the form submission:

* Checking for empty fields
* Verifying that passwords match

**Registration**

If the validation passes, the `register` action is called with the user's input data. If the registration is successful, the user is redirected to the main chat page using the `navigator` function.

**Component structure**

The component is organized into several `div` sections:

1. **Outer section**: The outermost container, with a gray background and basic layout styling.
2. ** Inner container**: A flexbox container that centers the content horizontally and vertically.
3. **Form container**: A white background container with a rounded corners and a shadow effect.
4. **Form sections**: Five form sections, each with a label, input field, and basic styling.
	* Full Name
	* Email
	* Password
	* Confirm Password
5. **Submit button**: A primary-colored button with a hover effect, used to submit the form.
6. **Already have an account**: A text section with a link to the login page.

Each form section has a similar structure:

* A `label` element with a text description
* An `input` element with basic styling, placeholder text, and required attribute
* The `value` attribute is bound to the corresponding state property using the `formData` object.
* The `onChange` event is handled by the `handleInputChange` function.

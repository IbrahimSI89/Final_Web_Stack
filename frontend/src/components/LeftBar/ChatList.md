**Concepts:**

1. **`React.FC`**: `React.FC` stands for "React Functional Component". It's a type alias in TypeScript that represents a functional component in React. In this case, `ChatList` is a functional component that takes no props.
2. **`useState`**: `useState` is a React Hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it. In this case, `useState` is used to manage the local state for the email input field.
3. **`useChatActions`**: `useChatActions` is a custom hook that provides actions to interact with the chat store, such as fetching chats and creating new ones.
4. **Event Handlers**: Event handlers are functions that handle events triggered by user interactions, such as form submissions or button clicks.

**Div Sections:**

**1. Container Div (`flex flex-col space-y-1 mt-4 -mx-2 overflow-y-auto`)**

* This div is the container for the entire chat list component.
* The styles applied to this div are:
	+ `flex`: sets the display property to flex
	+ `flex-col`: sets the flex direction to column
	+ `space-y-1`: adds a 1px gap between elements in the vertical direction
	+ `mt-4`: sets the margin top to 4px
	+ `-mx-2`: sets the margin left and right to -2px ( effectively removing the horizontal margin)
	+ `overflow-y-auto`: allows the div to scroll vertically if the content exceeds its height

**2. Input Form Div (`flex flex-row items-center p-2 relative`)**

* This div contains the input form for creating a new chat.
* The styles applied to this div are:
	+ `flex`: sets the display property to flex
	+ `flex-row`: sets the flex direction to row
	+ `items-center`: centers the elements in the div both horizontally and vertically
	+ `p-2`: adds 2px of padding in all directions
	+ `relative`: sets the position property to relative, allowing the button to be absolutely positioned

**3. Input Field**

* This is the input field where the user can enter the email of the other participant to create a new chat.
* The attributes and styles applied to this input field are:
	+ `value={email}`: binds the input field to the `email` state variable
	+ `required`: makes the input field required
	+ `onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}`: updates the `email` state variable when the input field changes
	+ `bg-transparent`: sets the background color to transparent
	+ `outline-none`: removes the outline when the input field is focused
	+ `focus:bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-100`: sets the background color to gray-100 on focus and hover
	+ `p-2`: adds 2px of padding in all directions
	+ `rounded-xl`: sets the border radius to extra large
	+ `w-full`: sets the width to full

**4. Create Chat Button**

* This button is used to create a new chat when clicked.
* The attributes and styles applied to this button are:
	+ `type='submit'`: makes the button a submit button
	+ `className='bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-600 rounded-full w-12 h-10 p-2 right-0 text-white absolute'`: applies various styles to the button, including:
		- `bg-indigo-500`: sets the background color to indigo-500
		- `hover:bg-indigo-600`: sets the background color to indigo-600 on hover
		- `rounded-full`: sets the border radius to full
		- `w-12 h-10`: sets the width and height to 12px and 10px, respectively
		- `p-2`: adds 2px of padding in all directions
		- `right-0`: sets the position to absolute and moves the button to the right edge of its parent
		- `text-white`: sets the text color to white
		- `absolute`: sets the position property to absolute, allowing the button to be positioned relative to its parent

**5. Chat List (`{chats && chats.map((chat) => ...)}`)**

* This section displays the list of chats the user is involved in.
* The code uses the `chats` state variable and the `map` method to iterate over the list of chats and render a `ChatCard` component for each chat.

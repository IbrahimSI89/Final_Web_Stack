**Concepts:**

1. **React.FC**: `React.FC` stands for "React Functional Component". It's a type of React component that doesn't have its own state and lifecycle methods. In this case, the `Board` component is a functional component that doesn't accept any props.
2. **useOpenChat**: This is a custom hook that provides access to the current chat from the chat store. It's used to retrieve the current chat and its messages.
3. **Socket.IO**: Socket.IO is a library that allows real-time communication between the client and server. In this case, it's used to listen for new messages and update the chat board when a new message is received.

**Div sections:**

1. **Outermost div**: The outermost div has the following classes: `flex`, `flex-col`, `h-full`, and `overflow-x-auto`. This div is used to contains the entire chat board. The classes are used to:
	* `flex`: Make the div a flex container.
	* `flex-col`: Make the div a column-based flex container.
	* `h-full`: Make the div take up the full height of its parent container.
	* `overflow-x-auto`: Make the div have a horizontal scrollbar if the content exceeds its width.
2. **Inner div**: The inner div has the following classes: `flex`, `flex-col`, and `h-full`. This div is used to contain the chat header and message list. The classes are used to:
	* `flex`: Make the div a flex container.
	* `flex-col`: Make the div a column-based flex container.
	* `h-full`: Make the div take up the full height of its parent container.
3. **Chat header div**: This div has the following classes: `text-sm`, `text-gray-500`, and `text-center`. It contains the chat creation date. The classes are used to:
	* `text-sm`: Make the text small.
	* `text-gray-500`: Make the text gray with a shade of 500.
	* `text-center`: Center the text horizontally.
4. **Message list div**: This div has the following classes: `flex`, `flex-col`, and `h-full`. It contains the list of messages. The classes are used to:
	* `flex`: Make the div a flex container.
	* `flex-col`: Make the div a column-based flex container.
	* `h-full`: Make the div take up the full height of its parent container.
5. **Message component**: Each message is rendered as a separate `Message` component, which is a child component of the `Board` component. The `Message` component is not shown in this code snippet, but it's used to display individual messages.
6. **Input component**: If the current chat is open, an `Input` component is rendered below the message list. This component allows the user to send new messages.
